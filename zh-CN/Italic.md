斜体很可能是字体设计中最容易误解的样式，但是它也有最大的潜在兴奋和乐趣，这是由于作为设计者的你有大量的变量可以玩。

斜体与粗体不同，这是由于斜体并不意味着与常规体有不同的粗细。相反他们意味着提供雨常规体不同的<em>纹理</em>。在这点不同上更大的强度意味着斜体尤其对创造与常规体的对比上有用。这一强烈影响对突出文本中单个词或短的段落有用。相反不同更小的纹理经常在你设置多条线、整个段落或整页为斜体的情况下有用。

## 倾斜

与斜体相关的最常见的变量是倾斜。事实上当网页浏览器在一个CSS规则中请求一个斜体但是不存在时，它将会简单地倾斜常规体来合成或仿造斜体。或许当人们第一次设计字体的时候会考虑这种方法，这或许并不令人惊奇。这一方法的来源要追溯到20世纪中叶现代主义应用到设计的时候。这是字体样式中最早的斜体比如Helvetica也是常规体的倾斜版本的原因。

### 倾斜多少？

一些斜体并不倾斜。是这样的，真的！这些斜体被称为垂直斜体。但是很可能如果你的设计中只有一个斜体，你将选择斜体来获得一定程度的倾斜。通常斜体倾向于倾斜4-14度。大多数当代字体倾斜6-9度。

倾斜对一个斜体的设计可以是重要的，因此这很容易注意到甚至通过使用自动筛选的有限成功来实现。这不是你可以用来帮助使斜体与常规体分开的唯一变量。除了倾斜之外你可能想要考虑使用如一个或多个变量。

## Italic construction

The term "italic" does not in fact refer to the slant seen in in many italics designs but instead refers instead to a style of writing which became popular in 14th century Italy. This style of writing was a faster and a connected form of writing which uses a different construction for its letters than is seen in regular. This different construction or pattern of strokes is what type designers are referring to when they say they have designed a "real" or "true" italic. This construction has many sub characteristics that you may choose to include in an italic design.

### Triangular counters

The most obvious of these characteristics is the triangular countershape created by letters with joins. These letters include a, b, d, g, h, m, n, p, q, and u. This variable is powerful, partly because countershape is a powerful variable, but also because of the great number of letters with the feature.  That fact, combined with the high frequency of their usage in most languages, is also a very large (and probably the even greater) factor.

When designing your italic, you can very effectively tune the effect your italic gives by making relatively small adjustments to the height of the joins. Subtle changes can give surprisingly large results. Still, not all italic fonts take advantage of this variable.

### In and out strokes

Many italic fonts make use of asymmetical serifs, in the form of in- or out-strokes, or both. When only one is used, it is more common to use the outstroke and to have an upright style applied where the instroke might have been. The intensity of the effect that instroke and outstroke has can be controlled by the weight of the strokes and by adjusting how long they are. Like triangular counters, a great part of their utility and power comes from the fact that so many letters use them.

### Condensation

Italics are normally somewhat less wide or more condensed than the regular style. Because condensation is a feature seen across all of the letters in the italic, it is a very powerful variable. This variable can be employed in both a gross and subtle manner. If you choose to use this variable, it is necessary to adjust the weight of the strokes to make the italic appear to be the same or nearly the same weight as the regular design. The more condensed your italic is, the more you will need to make this adjustment.

## Mixing variables

Most italics use all of the variables listed above in various proportions. You may find that it is useful to look at a range of italic designs and analyse which variables are being used and in what strength. When you do this, you will notice that none of the variables are used at full strength. Instead, one of the variables tends to lead, with some limited use of the others. The stronger the use of the variables the more contrast your italic will have from the regular.

In is also notable that in the last ten years we have seen an increasing number of type designers choose to offer not just one italic in their type families, but two or even more. It is also notable that dictionaries sometimes make use of more than one style of italic.

When they were first made for printing, italics were not thought of as part of the same type design or type family. This idea is one which became standard over the 19th and 20th Centuries. Even the idea of mixing italics with regular was not part of the original idea behind this script. The first italic fonts were used to set entire books, instead of the upright roman style. It is probably safe to assume that the role of the italic will continue to evolve.
