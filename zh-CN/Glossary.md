## A

### Abjad

辅音音素文字（Abjad）是一个闪族（Semitic）语言使用的书写系统类型（Hebrew，Arabic等）的技术术语，有表示所有辅音的字形但是读者必须准备好猜测两个辅音之间添加什么元音。

Hebrew与Arabic有可选的元音标记，被称作“不纯的”辅音因素文字。


另请参阅：字母表，元音附标文字，音节字母和相关的维基百科文章（[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad)）。

### Abugida

元音附标文字（Abugida）是字母表和音节字母之间的地方。印度语书写系统可能是最著名的元音附标文字。

在大多数元音附标文字中有独立的辅音字形，每个辅音都隐含地后面跟着一个默认的元音发音。所有的元音除了默认的都将被标记变音符号或一些其他基本辅音的修改。

一个元音附标文字与音节字母区别在于代表以给定的辅音为开始的音节的图片（也就是辅音的字形）有一个共同主题，而音节字母中即使两个以共同辅音为开始的音节字母其音节也不同。

一个元音附标文字与辅音音素文字不同之处在于元音（除了默认的）必须标记在在元音附标文字上。

另请参阅：字母表, 辅音音素文字，音节文字和相关的维基百科文章（[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida)）。

### 重音

### 先行宽度

当前字形的开始与下个字形的开始之间的距离。有时候被称作是字形的宽度。另请参阅竖直先行宽度。

### 字母表

一个拥有所有因素的字形书写系统&ndash;类似于辅音和元音&ndash;并且（无论如何在理论上）一个词中所有的音素会被标记上一个适当的字形。

牛耕式转行书写法（Boustrophedon）指的是“像牛耕一样”书写，书写方向从左到右和从右到左交替。早期字母表（老迦南语和非常早的希腊语（和出人意料的fuþark））使用它。从右到左的字形常常是从左到右的字形的镜像。据我所知，没有现代书写系统使用这种方法（OpenType也对它没有任何支持）。参见Bidi。

## C
### Cap-height

大写高度（Cap-height）是一个大写字母在基线上的高度（一个顶部平的字母比如“I”与弯曲的字母比如“O”截然相反）。

另请参阅X高度，顶部，底部，上突，基线。

### CFF

紧凑字体格式（Compact Font Format）在OpenType postscript字体内使用最普遍，即使没有SFNT包装也是一个有效的字体格式。这是带有PostScript Type2 CharStrings的字体的原生字体格式。

### Character

字符（Character）是柏拉图式的理想具体化到至少一个字形中。例如字母“s”是一个具体化到几种不同字形的字符，包括“S”，“s”，“*s*”，“&szlig;”，long-s等。需要注意的是这些字形可能看起来互相非常不同，但是尽管积分符号的字形可能与long-s字形相同，但它们是不同的字符。

### Character set

### CID

字符识别符（Character Identifier），一个数字。在一些CJK PostScript字体中，字形并没有命名但是通过字符识别符数字来引用。

### CID-keyed font

以CID为键的字体（CID-keyed font）中的字形通过CID而不是名称来索引。

### CJK

中文，日文，韩文（Chinese, Japanese, Korean）。这三种语言的需要字体带有数量庞大字形。这三者使用了相同的基于汉字的书写系统（尽管它们在各自国家经历了分割演化，中国大陆的字体也确实与台湾和香港所使用的不同）。

日文和韩文也有语音音节表。日文有两个音节表，平假名和有约60个音节的片假名。韩文有一个音节表，有数万个音节的韩文（Hangul）。

### CJKV

中文，日文，韩文，越南文（Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese）。这四种语言需要字体有数量庞大的字形。

### Condensed

紧缩（Condensed）字体的字形的茎之间的间距和字形之间的间距被缩减。

### Conflicting hints

如果一个字形包含两个提示，其中一个的开始或者结束点在另一个的范围内，那么这两个提示冲突。它们可能不会同时有效。

### Counter

一个字形的对立面（Counter）是字形中完全或部分闭合的白色部分。o和n都有对立面。i和l没有。e有对立面。B有两个对立面。
The counter of a glyph is the white part which is either fully or partially enclosed. The o and n both have counters. The i and l do not. The e and both have counters. The B has two counters.

## D
### Descender

另请参阅x高度，大写高度，顶部，上突，基线。

### Descent

在传统排印中字体的下降是从字体块的底部到基线的距离。

这意味着在现代排印中变得精确度更低。

### Device Table

设备表（Device Table）是OpenType中的一个概念，允许您输入间距的调整以准备好光栅化到特定的像素尺寸。如果一个在大多数时间都有效的字距值在一个12像素字体的字形中排列起来很丑，那么你可以添加一个特别的 到只应用在12像素的间距上（另一个是14，18，或者你需要的任何大小）。类似的功能锚标记也需要。

### Diacritics

许多语言采用了顶部或底部有标记字母，有时标记甚至穿过字母。这些标记被称作变音符号（Diacritics）。有时它们也被称作“重音（accents）”，尽管这是个不太准确的术语。这些字母的例子包括&Agrave; &agrave; &aring; &Aring; &Uuml; &uuml; &Oslash; &oslash; &Ccedil; &ccedil;。

### Didot point

迪多磅（Didot point）是欧洲的一种磅。每23.566毫米是62 2/3磅（2.66磅/毫米活着67.55磅每英寸）。也有“公制”的迪多磅：.4毫米。

### 变形字体

参见多主子字体。

## E
### em

一个线性单位，等于字体的磅值。在一个10磅的字体中，em将会是10磅。em-space是与磅值一样宽的空白空间。em-dash是一个与磅值一样宽的水平的条形。

em-square是一个每个边都是1em的正方形。在传统排印中（此时每个字母被铸造在金属上）字形必须绘制在em-square中。

### em unit

在一个可伸缩的字体中，“em”细分到单位。在一个Postscript字体中通常em有1000个单位。在一个TrueType字体中em可能有512，1024或2048个单位。在一个Ikarus字体中有15000个单位。FontForge使用这些单位作为其坐标系统的基础。

### en

“em”的一半

### Encoding

编码（Encoding）是
An encoding is a mapping from a set of bytes onto a character set. It is what determines which byte sequence represents which character. The words "encoding" and "character set" are often used synonymously. The specification for ASCII specifies both a character set and an encoding. But CJK character sets often have multiple encodings for the character set (and multiple character sets for some encodings).

In more complicated cases it is possible to have multiple glyphs associated with each character (as in arabic where most characters have at least 4 different glyphs) and the client program must pick the appropriate glyph for the character in the current context.

### Eth -- Edh

The old germanic letter "&eth;" for the voiced (English) "th" sound (the sound in "this" -- most English speakers aren't even aware that "th" in English has two sounds associated with it, but it does, see also Thorn)

### Even-Odd Fill rule

To determine if a pixel should be filled using this rule, draw a line from the pixel to infinity (in any direction) then count the number of times contours cross this line. If that number is odd then fill the point, if it is even then do not fill the point. This method is used for fonts by postscript rasterizers after level 2.0 of PostScript. See Also Non-Zero Winding Number Fill.

### Extended

An extended font is one where the space between the stems of the glyphs, and the distance between glyphs themselves has been increased.

### Extremum <em>(plural:</em> Extrema<em> )</em>

An extremum is the point on a mathematical curve where the curve attains its maximum or minimum value. On a continuous curve this can happen at the endpoints (which is dull) or where dx/dt=0 or dy/dt=0.

In font design, the extrema of a glyph are the top-most and bottom-most points of the outline, as well as its left-most and right-most points. Making sure that a glyph has on-curve points at all of its extrema is important, because it simplifies text rendering when the font is used.

## F
### Features (OpenType)

When creating fonts for complex scripts (and even for less complex scripts) various transformations (like ligatures) must be applied to the input glyphs before they are ready for display. These transformations are identified as font features and are tagged with (in OpenType) a 4 letter tag or (in Apple) a 2 number identifier. The meanings of these features are predefined by Microsoft and Apple. FontForge allows you to tag each lookup with one or several features when you create it (or later).

### Feature File

This is a text syntax designed by Adobe to describe OpenType features. It can be used to move feature and lookup information from one font to another.

### Feature/Settings (Apple)

These are roughly equivalent to OpenType's Features above, they are defined by Apple.

### Font

A collection of glyphs, generally with at least one glyph associated with each character in the font's character set, often with an encoding.

A font contains much of the information needed to turn a sequence of bytes into a set of pictures representing the characters specified by those bytes.

In traditional typesetting a font was a collection of little blocks of metal each with a graven image of a letter on it. Traditionally there was a different font for each point-size.

### Font Family, or Family

A collection of related fonts. Often including plain, italic and bold styles.

### FreeType

A library for rasterizing fonts. Used extensively in FontForge to understand the behavior of TrueType fonts and to do better rasterization than FontForge could accomplish unaided.

### Fu镁ark (Futhark)

The old germanic runic script.

## G
### Ghost Hint

Sometimes it is important to indicate that a horizontal edge is indeed horizontal. But the edge has no corresponding edge with which to make a normal stem. In this case a special hint is used with a width of -20 (or -21). A ghost hint must lie entirely within a glyph. If it is at the top of a contour use a width of -20, if at the bottom use -21. Ghost hints should also lie within BlueZones.<br>(The spec also mentions vertical ghost hints, but as there are no vertical bluezones it is not clear how these should be used).

### Glyph

A glyph is an image, often associated with one or several characters. So the glyph used to draw "f" is associated with the character f, while the glyph for the "fi" ligature is associated with both f and i. In simple latin fonts the association is often one to one (there is exactly one glyph for each character), while in more complex fonts or scripts there may be several glyphs per character (In renaissance printing the letter "s" had two glyphs associated with it, one, the long-s, was used initially and medially, the other, the short-s, was used only at the end of words). And in the ligatures one glyph is associated with two or more characters.

Fonts are collections of glyphs with some form of mapping from character to glyph.

### Grid Fitting

Before TrueType glyphs are rasterized they go through a process called grid fitting where a tiny program (associated with each glyph) is run which moves the points on the glyph's outlines around until they fit the pixel grid better.

### Gothic

The German monks at the time of Gutenberg used a black-letter writing style, and he copied their handwriting in his typefaces for printing. Italian type designers (after printing spread south) sneered at the style, preferring the type designs left by the Romans. As a term of contempt they used the word gothic, the style of the Goths who helped destroy the roman empire.

### Graphite tables

Graphite is an extension to TrueType which embeds several tables into a font containing rules for contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality, stacking diacritics, complex positioning, etc.

This sounds rather like OpenType -- except that OpenType depends on the text layout routines knowing a lot about the glyphs involved. This means that OpenType fonts cannot be designed for a new language or script without shipping a new version of the operating system. Whereas Graphite tables contain all that hidden information.

Apple's Advanced Typography provides a better comparison, but Graphite tables are supposed to be easier to build.

SIL International provides a free Graphite compiler .

### Grotesque

See also sans-serif.

## H
### Han characters

The ideographic characters used in China, Japan and Korea (and, I believe, in various other asian countries as well (Vietnam?)), all based on the writing style that evolved in China.

### Hangul

The Korean syllabary. The only syllabary (that I'm aware of anyway) based on an alphabet -- the letters of the alphabet never appear alone, but only as groups of two or three making up a syllable.

### Hanja

The Korean name for the Han characters

### Hints

These are described in detail in the main manual. They help the rasterizer to draw a glyph well at small pointsizes.

### Hint Masks

At any given point on a contour hints may not conflict. However different points in a glyph may need conflicting hints. So every now and then a contour will change which hints are active. Each list of active hints is called a hint mask.

### Hiragana

One of the two Japanese syllabaries. Both Hiragana and Katakana have the same sounds.

## I
### Ideographic character

A single character which represents a concept without spelling it out. Generally used to mean Han (Chinese) characters.

### Italic

A slanted style of a font, often used for emphasis.

Italic differs from Oblique in that the transformation from the plain to the slanted form involves more than just skewing the letterforms. Generally the lower-case a changes to *a*, the serifs on lower-case letters like i (*i*) change, and the font generally gains a more flowing feeling.

## J
### Jamo

The letters of the Korean alphabet. These are almost never seen alone, generally appearing in groups of three as part of a Hangul syllable. The Jamo are divided into three categories (with considerable overlap between the first and third), the choseong -- initial consonants, the jungseong -- medial vowels, and the jongseong -- final consonants. A syllable is composed by placing a choseong glyph in the upper left of an em-square, a jungseong in the upper right, and optionally a jongseong in the lower portion of the square.

## K
### Kanji

The Japanese name for the Han characters.

### Katakana

One of the two (modern) Japanese syllabaries. Both Hiragana and Katakana have the same sounds.

### Kerning

When the default spacing between two glyphs is inappropriate the font may include extra information to indicate that when a given glyph (say "T") is followed by another glyph (say "o") then the advance width of the "T" should be adjusted by a certain amount to make for a more pleasing display.

In the days of metal type, metal actually had to be shaved off the slug of type to provide a snugger fit. In the image on the side, the "F" on the left has had some metal removed so that a lower case letter could snuggle closer to it.

### Kern pair

A pair of glyphs for which kerning information has been specified.

### Kerning by classes

The glyphs of the font are divided into classes of glyphs and there is a large table which specifies kerning for every possible combination of classes. Generally this will be smaller than the equivalent set of kerning pairs because each class will usually contain several glyphs.

### Knuth, Donald

A mathematician who got so fed up with bad typesetting back in the 1970 &amp; 80s that he created his own font design system and typographical layout program called, respectively, MetaFont and TeX.

## L
### Left side bearing

The horizontal distance from a glyph's origin to its leftmost extent. This may be negative or positive.

### Lemur

A monotypic genus of prosimian primates, now found only on Madagascar but formally (about 50 million years ago) members of this family were much more wide spread.

### Ligature

A single glyph which is composed of two adjacent glyphs. A common example in the latin script is the "fi" ligature which has a nicer feel to it than the sequence.

### Linespace

The distance between successive lines of type.

### LGC

Latin, Greek, Cyrillic. These three alphabets have evolved side by side over the last few thousand years. The letter forms are very similar (and some letters are shared). Many concepts such as "lower case", "italic" are applicable to these three alphabets and not to any others. (OK, Armenian also has lower case letters).

## M
### Manyogana

An early Japanese script, ancestral to both hiragana and katakana. Manyogana used kanji for their phonetic sounds, and over the years these kanji were simplified into hiragana and katakana.

### Monospace

A font in which all glyphs have the same width. These are sometimes called typewriter fonts.

### Multi-layered fonts

(FontForge's own term) PostScript type3 fonts and SVG fonts allow for more drawing possibilities than normal fonts. Normal fonts may only be filled with a single color inherited from the graphics environment. These two fonts may be filled with several different colors, stroked, include images, have gradient fills, etc.. FontForge can be configured to support these fonts (it does not do so by default because this takes up more memory).

```
$ configure --with-type3
$ make
$ make install
```

### Multiple Master Font

A multiple master font is a PostScript font schema which defines an infinite number of related fonts. Multiple master fonts can vary along several axes, for example you might have a multiple master which defined both different weights and different widths of a font family, it could be used to generate: Thin, Normal, Semi-Bold, Bold, Condensed, Expanded, Bold-Condensed, etc.<br>Adobe is no longer developing this format. Apple has a format which achieves the same effect but has not produced many examples. FontForge supports both.

## N
### Namelist

A mapping from Unicode code point to glyph name.

### Non-Zero Winding Number Fill rule

To determine if a pixel should be filled using this rule draw a line from here to infinity (in any direction) and count the number of times contours cross this line. If the contour crosses the line in a clockwise direction add 1, of the contour crosses in a counter clockwise direction subtract one. If the result is non-zero then fill the pixel. If it is zero leave it blank. This method is used for rasterizing fonts by TrueType and older (before version 2) postscript.

See Also Even-Odd Fill Rule.

## O
### Ogham

The old Celtic inscription script.

### OpenType

A type of font. It is an attempt to merge postscript and TrueType fonts into one specification.<br>An OpenType font may contain either a TrueType or a postscript font inside it.

It contains many of the same data tables for information like encodings that were present in TrueType fonts.

Confusingly it is also used to mean the advanced typographic tables that Adobe and Microsoft (but not Apple) have added to TrueType. These include things like contextual ligatures, contextual kerning, glyph substitution, etc.

And MS Windows uses it to mean a font with a 'DSIG' (Digital Signature) table.

### OpenType Tables

Each OpenType font contains a collection of tables each of which contains a certain kind of information.

### Oblique

A slanted style of a font, generally used for emphasis.

Oblique differs from Italic in that the transformation from the plain to the slanted form involves a mathematical or mechanical skewing the letterforms.

### Overshoot    

In order for the curved shape of the "O" to appear to be the same height as the flat top of the "I" it tends to "overshoot" the cap-height (or x-height), or undershoot the baseline by about 3% of the cap-height (or x-height). For a triangular shape (such as "A") the overshoot is even greater, perhaps 5%.

These guidelines are based on the way the eye works and the optical illusions it generates and are taken from Peter Karow's Digital Formats for Typefaces, p. 26).

The overshoot is also dependent on the point-size of a font, the larger the point-size the smaller the overshoot should be. Generally modern fonts will be used at multiple point-sizes, but in some font families there are multiple faces for the different point-sizes, and in such a case the overshoot will probably vary from face to face.

See also X-height, Cap-height, Ascender, Descender, Baseline

## P
### Panose

A system for describing fonts. See <a title="Unicode consortium" href="http://www.panose.com/ProductsServices/pan1.aspx">HP's PANOSE classification metrics guide</a>. There is also an extension called <a title="Unicode consortium" href="http://www.w3.org/Fonts/Panose/pan2.html">Panose 2</a>.

FontForge only knows about the classification scheme for Latin fonts. Other schemes exist for other scripts.

### PfaEdit

This was the early name for FontForge. The original conception was that it would only edit type1 ASCII fonts (hence the name), it quickly metamorphosed beyond that point, but it took me three years to rename it.

### Phantom points

In a TrueType font there are a few points added to each glyph which are not specified by the contours that make up the glyph. These are called phantom points. One of these points represents the left side bearing, and the other the advance width of the glyph. TrueType instructions (hints) are allowed to move these points around just as any other points may be moved -- thus changing the left-side-bearing or the advance width. Early versions of TrueType supplied just these two phantoms, more recent versions also supply a phantom for the top sidebearing and a phantom for the vertical advance width.

### Pica

A unit of length defined (in the US at least) to be 35/83cm (or approximately 1/6th of an inch). This was used for measuring the length of lines of text (as "30 picas and 4 points long"), but not for measuring font heights.

In Renaissance typography, before there were points, sizes of type had names, and "pica" was used in this context. As: "Great Canon", "Double Pica", "Great Primer", "English", "Pica", "Primer", "Small Pica", "Brevier", "Nonpareil" and "Pearl" (each name representing a progressively smaller size of type) and <a title="Unicode consortium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet">See Caslon's type specimen sheet on Wikipedia</a>.

### Pica point

The Anglo-American point. With 72.27 points per inch ( 2.85pt /mm).

### Point

A point is a unit of measurement. There were three (at least) different definitions for "point" in common usage before the advent of computers. The one in use in the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the "pica point" with 72.27 points per inch ( 2.85pt /mm ), while the one used in continental Europe was the didot point with 62 2/3 points per 23.566mm ( 2.66pt/mm or 67.54pt/inch ) and the French sometimes used the Median point (72.78 points per inch, 2.86pt/mm).

The didot and pica points were so arranged that text at a given point-size would have approximately the same cap-height in both systems, the didot point would have extra white-space above the capitals to contain the accents present in most non-English Latin based scripts.

This has the interesting side effect that a font designed for European usage should have a smaller proportion of the vertical em given over to the text body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore this, so presumably European printers now set with more leading.

As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in approximations to pica points (but this may be because I am in the US), PostScript uses a unit of 1/72nd of an inch.

Originally fonts were not described by point size, but by name. It was not until the 1730s that Pierre Fournier that created the point system for specifying font heights. This was later improved upon by Fran&ccedil;ois-Ambroise Didot (hence the name of the point). In 1878 the Chicago Type Foundry first used a point system in the US. In 1886 the US point was standardized -- the pica was defined to be 35/83cm, and the pica point defined to be 1/12th of that.

### Point Size

In traditional typography a 10pt font was one where the block of metal for each glyph was 10 points high. The point size of a font is the unleaded baseline to baseline distance.

### Point of inflection

A point on a curve where it changes from being concave downwards to concave upwards (or vice versa). Or in mathematical terms (for continuous curves) where d&sup2;y/dx&sup2;=0 or infinity.<br>Cubic splines may contain inflection points, quadratic splines may not.

### PostScript

PostScript is a page-layout language used by many printers. The language contains the specifications of several different font formats. The main (FontForge) manual has a section describing how PostScript differs from TrueType.

* Type 1: This is the old standard for PostScript fonts. Such a font generally has the extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limited to a one byte encoding (i.e. only 256 glyphs may be encoded).
* Type 2/CFF: This is the format used within OpenType fonts. It is almost the same as Type 1, but has a few extensions and a more compact format. It is usually inside a CFF wrapper, which is usually inside an OpenType font. The CFF font format again only allows a 1 byte encoding, but the OpenType wrapper extends this to provide more complex encoding types.
* Type 3: This format allows full postscript within the font, but it means that no hints are allowed, so these fonts will not look as nice at small point-sizes. Also most (screen) rasterizers are incapable of dealing with them. A type 3 font is limited to a one byte encoding (i.e. only 256 glyphs may be encoded).
* Type 0: This format is used for collecting many sub-fonts (of Type 1, 2 or 3) into one big font with a multi-byte encoding, and was used for CJK or Unicode fonts.
* Type 42: A TrueType font wrapped up in PostScript. Sort of the opposite from OpenType.
* CID: This format is used for CJK fonts with large numbers of glyphs. The glyphs themselves are specified either as type1 or type2 glyph format. The CID font itself has no encoding, just a mapping from CID (a number) to glyph. An set of external CMAP files are used to provide appropriate encodings as needed.



### Python
<div>A computer programming language that emphasizes code readability.</div>
## R
### Reference

A reference is a way of storing the outlines of one glyph in another (for example in accented glyphs). Sometimes called a component.

### Right side bearing

The horizontal distance from a glyph's rightmost extent to the glyph's advance width. This may be positive or negative.

## S
### Sans Serif

See Serif.

### Script

A script is a character set and associated rules for putting characters together. Latin, arabic, katakana and hanja are all scripts.

### Serif

Back two thousand years ago when the Romans were carving their letters on stone monuments, they discovered that they could reduce the chance of the stone cracking by adding fine lines at the terminations of the main stems of a glyph.

These fine lines were called serifs, and came to have an aesthetic appeal of their own. Early type designers added them to their fonts for aesthetic rather than functional reasons.

At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, type-designers started designing fonts without serifs. These were initially called grotesques because their form appeared so strange, they are now generally called sans-serif.

Other writing systems (Hebrew for one) have their own serifs. Hebrew serifs are rather different from latin (cyrillic, greek) serifs and I don't know their history. Hebrew serifs only occur at the top of a glyph.

### SFD

SplineFont Database. These are FontForge's own personal font representation. The files are ASCII and vaguely readable, the format is described here. As of 14 May 2008 the format has been registered with IANA for a MIME type: application/vnd.font-fontforge-sfd.<br>Other people use the acronym 'sfd' too. (Unfortunately)

* Tops-10, on the Digital PDP-10 used sfd to mean "Sub File Directory". Tops-10 made a distinction between top-level (home) directories, called "user file directories", and sub-directories.
* TeX uses it to mean "Sub Font Definition" where a TeX sfd file contains information on how to break a big CJK or Unicode font up into small sub-fonts, each with a 1 byte encoding which TeX (or older versions of TeX) needed.



### SFNT

The name for the generic font format which contains TrueType, OpenType, Apple's bitmap only, X11's bitmap only, obsolete 'typ1' fonts and Adobe's SING fonts (and no doubt others). The SFNT format describes how font tables should be laid out within a file. Each of the above formats follow this general idea but include more specific requirements (such as what tables are needed, and the format of each table).

### SIP

### State machine

A state machine is like a very simple little program, they are used on the mac for performing contextual substitutions and kerning. The state machine dialog is reachable from Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups.

The "state machine" consists of a table of states, each state in turn consists of a series of potential transitions (to the same or different states) depending on the input. In state machines within fonts, the machine starts out in a special state called the start state, and reads the glyph stream of the text. Each individual glyph will cause a state transition to occur. As these transitions occur the machine may also specify changes to the glyph stream (conditional substitutions or kerning).

### Stem

A stem is the part of the letter which is vertical. The I and l are all stem except for serifs. The H consists of two stems and a crossbar. Other glyphs with stems include B b F f K k P p R r 1 and 4.

### Strike

A particular instance of a font. Most commonly a bitmap strike is a particular pixelsize of a font.

### Style

There are various conventional variants of a font. In probably any writing system the thickness of the stems of the glyphs may be varied, this is called the weight of a font. Common weights are normal and bold.

In LGC alphabets an italic (or oblique) style has arisen and is used for emphasis.

Fonts are often compressed into a condensed style, or expanded out into an extended style.

Various other styles are in occasional use: underline, overstrike, outline, shadow.

### SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics. An XML format used for drawing vector images. It includes a font format.

### Syllabary

A syllabary is a phonetic writing system like an alphabet. Unlike an alphabet the sound-unit which is written is a syllable rather than a phoneme. In Japanese KataKana the sound "ka" is represented by one glyph. Syllabaries tend to be bigger than alphabets (Japanese Katakana requires about 60 different characters, while the Korean Hangul requires tens of thousands).

## T
### Terminal

The terminal of a glyph is the part where the stroke ends. The Top of the f has a terminal. The s has two terminals. When a glyph has serifs the serifs are considered different from the serifs. Because the bottom of the f would have a serif if it is in a serif style bottom is not considered a terminal. The bottom of the j and y are however considered terminals. Similarly the 3 has two terminals one at the top and one the bottom. The middle is considered to be a join rather than a terminal. The classification of these parts is perhaps more determined by convention than by a strict logic.

### TeX

A typesetting package.

### Thorn

The germanic letter "镁" used for the unvoiced (English) "th" sound (as in the word "thorn"), I believe this is approximately the same sound value as Greek Theta. Currently a corrupt version of this glyph survives as "ye" for "the". See also Eth.

### True Type

A type of font invented by Apple and shared with Microsoft. It specifies outlines with second degree (quadratic) B&eacute;zier curves, contains innovative hinting controls, and an expandable series of tables for containing whatever additional information is deemed important to the font.<br>Apple and Adobe/Microsoft have expanded these tables in different ways to include advanced typographic features needed for non-latin scripts (or for complex latin scripts). See Apple Advanced Typography and OpenType.

### TrueType Tables

Each truetype font contains a collection of tables each of which contains a certain kind of information.

### Type 1

A type of PostScript font.

### Type 2

A type of PostScript font, used within OpenType font wrappers.

### Type 3

A very general type of PostScript font.

### Type 0

A type of PostScript font.

### Type High

In the days of metal type this was the height of the piece of metal -- the distance from the printing surface to the platform on which it rested.

### Typewriter

See Monospace.

## U
### Unicode

A character set/encoding which tries to contain all the characters currently used in the world, and many historical ones as well. See the <a title="Unicode consortium" href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode consortium</a>.

### Undershoot

See Overshoot.

### UniqueID

This is a field in a PostScript font, it was formerly used as a mechanism for identifying fonts uniquely, then Adobe decided it was not sufficient and created the XUID (extended Unique ID) field. Adobe has now decided that both are unneeded.

There is a very similar field in the TrueType 'name' table.

### UseMyMetrics

This is a truetype concept which forces the width of an composite glyph (for example an accented letter) to be the same as the width of one of its components (for example the base letter being accented).

## V
### Vertical Advance Width

CJK text is often written vertically (and sometimes horizontally), so each CJK glyph has a vertical advance as well as a horizontal advance.

## W
### Weight

The weight of a font is how thick (dark) the stems of the glyphs are. Traditionally weight is named, but recently numbers have been applied to weights.

Thin<br>100

Extra-Light<br>200

Light<br>300

Normal<br>400

Medium<br>500

Demi-Bold<br>600

Bold<br>700

Heavy<br>800

Black<br>900

Nord

Ultra

### White space

The white space of the type design includes the space between lines of text, the space between the letters, the word space and the spaces inside the letters. It is a broad and encompassing term.

### Width

This is a slightly ambiguous term and is sometimes used to mean the advance width (the distance from the start of this glyph to the start of the next glyph), and sometimes used to mean the distance from the left side bearing to the right side bearing.

## X
### X-height

The height of a lower case letter above the base line (with a flat top like "x" or "z" or "v" as opposed to one with a curved top like "o" or one with an ascender like "l") .

See also Cap-height, Ascender, Descender, Overshoot, Baseline.

### XUID

Extended Unique ID in a PostScript font. Now somewhat obsolete. See Unique ID.
