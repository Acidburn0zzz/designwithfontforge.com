This book has been produced to help make the process of type design available to anyone. Type design is visually complex as well as highly technical. However it is easier to begin making type now than ever. Partly this is because of free access to excellent tools such as FontForge. It is certainly a fairly ideal platform in which to begin. That said, FontForge is not just a beginner's tool. It is also highly capable and is rapidly improving at the time this book is being written.

This book is partly meant to offer technical help and partly meant to offer general insights into planning a type design project, and also offers advice about how to make your workflow more efficient.

The authors of this book hope that you not only benefit from using it but that you contribute to making better by giving feedback or even by contributing content and fixes to future editions.</p>
