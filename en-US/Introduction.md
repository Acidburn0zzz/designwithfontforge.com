This book has been produced to help make the process of type design available to anyone. Type design
is visually complex as well as highly technical &ndash; however it is easier to begin making type
now than ever, partly because of the availability of free tools like [FontForge]. While being a
handy tool with which to begin, FontForge is not just for beginners. It has an advanced toolset
and is rapidly improving at the time this book is being written.

This book aims to offer technical help and general insight into planning a type design project, and
also offers advice about how to make your workflow more efficient.

The authors of this book hope that you not only benefit from using it but that you contribute to
making it better by giving feedback or even by contributing content and fixes [on GitHub].
