It may sound funny to pay special attention to the word space, however it is one of the most
commonly used parts of a type design.  
A word space that is too wide or too narrow can ruin the design of a font. It’s not too early to
begin considering the word spacing as long as you have your first characters set up. The choice you
make at this point should be gradually adjusted while you progress in the design of the font.

The word space here is too tight&hellip;

&hellip;and here, it’s too wide.

Now that’s well-balanced.

If your type is meant to be used at larger sizes, then the word space can be reduced &ndash; and
*vice-versa* if it’s to be used at very small sizes.

<p class="note">The research has shown that a word space that’s too large is more tolerable than one
that’s too small; so if you are unsure you may want to error in that direction.<br>
Similar studies have shown that younger children in particular benefit a little from word spaces
larger than what’s considered normal for adult readers.</p>
